HOW TO BUILD A FIRMWARE FOR THE ACTIONTEC TELUS WCB3000N

* How to install the WCB3000N source code onto the Linux workstation
* How to build the image file that can be loaded on to a WCB3000N

NOTE: The following procedures are known to work with recent version of 
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop.  

The WCB3000N Source Code can be obtained from the Actiontec 
support website at http://opensource.actiontec.com.

1.(Install clean OS Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop.)

2.(Download source code.)

 WECB-TELUS-GPL-0.16.2.5.tgz
  
3.(Copy or Move the source code to your working directory.)

$ cp WECB-TELUS-GPL-0.16.2.5.tgz  /<working directory>

4.(Install required packages. Please make sure you have installed necessary lib for compile the project)

$ sudo apt-get -y install gcc g++ m4 binutils patch bzip2 flex bison make autoconf gettext texinfo unzip sharutils subversion build-essential libncurses5-dev ncurses-term zlib1g-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install linux-headers-`uname -r` libnewt-dev curl sox libssl-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install gawk flex gettext mtd-utils util-linux

5.(Change to the WECB-TELUS-GPL directory)

6.(Extract the GPL source code and toolchain to your working directory. Make sure your
   working directory path does not contain spaces.)

$ tar xvfz WECB-TELUS-GPL-0.16.2.5.tgz 

IMPORTANT: Extracting the source code creates the directory "WECB-TELUS-GPL-0.16.2.5" 

7.(Change to the WECB-TELUS-GPL directory)

$ cd <working directory>/WECB-TELUS-GPL-0.16.2.5/rtl819x

8.(Build the image)

$./do_act_build TELUS WCB3000

Notes: If some syntax errors occured (Maybe in Ubuntu system), make sure that your /bin/sh is linked to the bash not the dash. To correct this run the following commands.

$ sudo rm /bin/sh
$ sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh

8.(Binary will be under. <working directory>/WECB-TELUS-GPL-0.16.2.5/rtl819x/image/TELUS-WCB3000-?verion?-act.bin)
